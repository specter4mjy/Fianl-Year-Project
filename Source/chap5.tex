\section{Final schematic}

My final circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:final schematic} which contains four parts. They are voltage amplifier, Class AB output stage, current source and negative feeedback part.

\subsection{Voltage amplifier}  

This part used to amplify input signal voltage, this means the output voltage of this part is hundreds times of input signal.


In this part, NPN transistor Q1 and PNP transistor Q2 are key component which provide the capability of amplifying signal voltage. Resister R14 and R3 consist of voltage diveder which set the DC operating point. Resistor R2 and capacitor C5 consist of a low pass filter which eliminate noise in DC power.

Capacitor C3 used to makesure amplifier DC voltage gain is 1 and only amplify signal AC part.
