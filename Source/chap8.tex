\chapter{Conclusion}
From doing this project, I learned how to use NPN transistor to amplify signal, using negative feedback control output gain and eliminate internal distortion, using transistor and diodes make current source, distinguish different type of output stage, drawing PCB board ,soldering PCB board and test it.

Also, I connect my headphone amplifier with my classmate's microphone amplifier which can amplify the microphone signal and output to the speaker.The system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:micophone amplifier and headphone amplifier system}.

And last,thanks our supervisor Declan for teaching us all this theory and guide us using equipments to test our boards.Without his patient teaching, I couldn't this high performance headphone amplifier.
